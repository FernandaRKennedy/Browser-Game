Browser Game


This game is a replication of the Google Dino game. It was a challenge and a pleasure to make it. 
Instructions:
Use the space bar  or any key to jump over the cupcake. If the character does not jump and collides with the cupcake then the game will be over. The collision is recognized by the programmed collision detection.  The score is calculated by time, 1 second equals 1 point. 
The game is not yet functional for cellphones. Please use your desktop to use it correctly.
